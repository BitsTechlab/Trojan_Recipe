# Trojan_Recipe
***
## Project Desctiprion
I have developed a trojan embedded within a simple recipe book application. The trojan sends a text message from the victim android mobile phone when the recipe book application is run. This message is sent everytime the recipe book application is opened.

## Dependencies
This project has been built in Android Studio, using Gradle configurations. Latest version of Android Studio can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

## Installation
For installation, you just need to download/clone this repository.

## Tutorial
Refer to the Trojan_Recipe [wiki](https://github.com/shivenchawla/Trojan_Recipe/wiki) for tutorial on creating the malicious tictactoe game.
